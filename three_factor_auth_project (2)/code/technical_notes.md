# Technical Notes

This project demonstrates a three-factor authentication flow:
1. Username + password (knowledge)
2. SMS-based OTP (possession)
3. Fingerprint verification on Android (inherence)

The code samples in this folder are illustrative and can be integrated into a full application with a proper database, SMS gateway, and Android project structure.
